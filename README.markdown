# [Bike Index](https://bikeindex.org) Wordpress Widget

This widget provides a way to easily list bicycles that have been registered with [BikeIndex.org](https://bikeindex.org) on your own Wordpress site in manageable widget form.

Settings allow you to list bikes closest to you by geocoding off of your zipcode , and to either show a mix of non-stolen/stolen bikes or to show only stolen bikes, depending on your site's needs. It uses the BikeIndex.org API to quickly pull and display listings, and is CURL-dependent. 

This widget is a great way to present a list of "stolen bicycles near you" to better serve your site visitors, and to help recover bikes with the Bike Index. 

### About Bike Index

The Bike Index is an [open source](https://github.com/bikeindex/bike_index) bicycle registry that is out to save people the agony of bike theft. We work with countless partners like bike shops, bikers, pro-bike orgs and police departments to act as a clearinghouse for bike ownership and stolen bike information. 

Through our stolen site - [stolen.bikeindex.org](https://stolen.bikeindex.org) - we maintain an easily queryable database of stolen bikes - and work with people to chase their bikes down when  they pop up on our radar. Along the way we do even more interesting things, like run the [@isitstolen](https://twitter.com/isitstolen) twitterbot - and help countless bike theft victims navigate their way around the horrible process of chasing bike thieves on Craigslist.

### About this widget:

This widget contains several settings: 

Zipcode - what zipcode the widget should use to determine what "near you" means

Radius (mi) - how large of a search radius to search on, in miles  

Maximum Bikes to Show:  - the maximum number of bikes to be displayed in the widget

Show stolen only  - shows only those bikes reported as STOLEN. Default settings are to show a mix of stolen and not stolen bikes, but checking this will show only bikes marked as STOLEN on BikeIndex.org
